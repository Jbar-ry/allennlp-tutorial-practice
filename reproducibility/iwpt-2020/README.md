Work in progress: We aim to have this documentation ready for the start of the conference.

## Basic Parser

The file `udpipe-future-models-used-in-dev.tsv` shows what models we used during development.
A `+` in the treebanks column means that a multi-treebank model was trained.
The prefix `task.` means that a treebank as distributed by the shared task was used.
The prefix `ud25.` means that a treebank from the UD v2.5 release was used.


## Semantic Parser

The file `allennlp-models-used-in-dev.txt` shows what models we used during development.
TODO:
* explain name format
* create a similar file for test
* upload models somewhere (we have them on google drive already, maybe this location is ok? only needs to be made public then) and provide link

Note that there are two 20200419-230600 and -232103 models in the model folder but
we only used one each.
