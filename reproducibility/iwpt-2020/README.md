Semantic Parser

The file `allennlp-models-used-in-dev.txt` shows what models we used during development.
TODO:
* explain name format
* create a similar file for test
* upload models somewhere (we have them on google drive already, maybe this location is ok? only needs to be made public then) and provide link

Note that there are two 20200419-230600 and -232103 models in the model folder but
we only used one each.
